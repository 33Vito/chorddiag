# Create a D3 Chord Diagram

The `chorddiag` package allows to create interactive chord diagrams using the JavaScript visualization library D3 (http://d3js.org). Chord diagrams show directed relationships among a group of entities. The chord diagram layout is explained in detail here: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Chord-Layout. 

To quote the explanation found there:

> Consider a hypothetical population of people with different hair colors: black, blonde, brown and red. Each person in this population has a preferred hair color for a dating partner; of the 29,630 (hypothetical) people with black hair, 40% (11,975) prefer partners with the same hair color. This preference is asymmetric: for example, only 10% of people with blonde hair prefer black hair, while 20% of people with black hair prefer blonde hair. A chord diagram visualizes these relationships by drawing quadratic BÃ©zier curves between arcs. The source and target arcs represents two mirrored subsets of the total population, such as the number of people with black hair that prefer blonde hair, and the number of people with blonde hair that prefer black hair.

To create a chord diagram for this example, we need the preferences in matrix format:

```{r}
m <- matrix(c(11975,  5871, 8916, 2868,
              1951, 10048, 2060, 6171,
              8010, 16145, 8090, 8045,
              1013,   990,  940, 6907),
            byrow = TRUE,
            nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
groupNames <- c("black", "blonde", "brown", "red")

row.names(m) <- groupNames
colnames(m) <- groupNames
m
```

Then, the `chorddiag` function creates the chord diagram:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(chorddiag)
groupColors <- c("#000000", "#FFDD89", "#957244", "#F26223")
chorddiag(m, groupColors = groupColors, groupnamePadding = 20)
```

This diagram will be interactive when generated by the function. The package's code is based on http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062006.


## Updating to the latest version of chorddiag

You can track (and contribute to) development of `chorddiag` at https://github.com/mattflor/chorddiag. To install it, run the following command (this requires the `devtools` package):

```r
devtools::install_github("mattflor/chorddiag")
```
